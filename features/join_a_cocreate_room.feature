  Scenario: when I am not logged in
    Given there is an idea
    And I'm a logged user
    And I was previously approved
    And I'm in "this idea page"
    When I click "Sala de cocriação"
    Then I should be in "the login page"
    When I click "entre com sua conta do Facebook"
    Then I should be in "the idea's cocreate page"
